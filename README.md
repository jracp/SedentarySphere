## Use case
To determine Activity States (Sleep, Sedentary, Light, Moderate, Vigorous) and Posture (Sit/Lie, Stand) for extracted data from GENEActiv on 100Hz sampling rate and 15 seconds epochs based on [Sedentary Sphere: Wrist-Worn Accelerometer-Brand Independent Posture Classification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559451) by Alex V. Rowlands, Thomas Yates, Tim S. Olds, Melanie Davies, Kamlesh Khunti, And Charlotte L. Edwardson.

## Method
Input data should be store next to the code and renamed to "Sed_Sph_data.csv". After running the code, an output called "Sed_Sph_data_labeled.csv" will be created with Activity States and Posture labels in the same path.
